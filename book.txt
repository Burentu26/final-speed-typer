Would you like to think more complexly? Understand why certain things happen
to you sometimes seemingly by chance, sometime seemingly by law? Or to
become more productive finding shortcuts where no one else is looking? What
about improving your relationships understanding why certain arguments truly
arise? What would you think if I told you that you can achieve these things by
working smarter, not harder? I’ve yet to meet a person who wouldn’t say “Sign
me up!” I, too, want all of those things for my life. I’m here to show you how it
just might be possible with a shift in your thinking. A paradigm shift in the way
you think about the world to systems thinking.
